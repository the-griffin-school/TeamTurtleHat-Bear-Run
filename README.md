Project Proposal
 We will be creating a 2d plat former game with processing where the player will move through a scrolling environment, which will progressively move faster the longer the player survives. There will be either one or two player inputs: jump and possibly duck. There will be a main menu, pause screen, death screen, and a point system. If there is enough time, we would like to include a way to score high scores, and settings. The player will be controlling a bear, whose goal is to destroy as many buildings as possible. Each time the bear destroys a building the amount of points goes up. However, the player can die by a few ways including not limited to: bear traps, armed villagers with pitchforks and torches, and fire pits. If we are able to complete a basic setup of the game, we would also like to add animation to the buildings being destroyed, the bear, and other objects like the villagers and torches.

 Our group will attack this beast that is our game by first creating a very basic scrolling environment, and slowly adding individual components until we have a fully functioning game. As of right now we don’t really know exactly what order we’ll be adding the different parts of the game, but I assume we will add basic things first like images and basic menus before we move on to more complicated and unnecessary things like animation. During class, at least in the beginning of the project, we will probably only have one person coding on a computer. However, it is possible as we have the opportunity to add more feature we could have two or even three people working in class at a time. Outside of class, once we get the foundation of the game laid down, we will most likely set jobs for people to complete. For example, one person could be in charge of the main menu, while another is responsible for the traps.

 Inspiration:
  1. The Mario franchise more specifically: Super Mario Run
  2. Braid
  3. The Smurfs: Epic Run

  Possible Libraries:
  1. 2d physics library
  2. maybe a gif library if processing doesn't support gifs (Cho doesn't know so...)
